## Server Requirements

The Laravel framework has a few system requirements. Of course, all of these requirements are satisfied by the Laravel Homestead virtual machine, so it's highly recommended that you use Homestead as your local Laravel development environment.

However, if you are not using Homestead, you will need to make sure your server meets the following requirements:

* PHP >= 7.1.3
* OpenSSL PHP Extension
* PDO PHP Extension
* Mbstring PHP Extension
* Tokenizer PHP Extension
* XML PHP Extension
* Ctype PHP Extension
* JSON PHP Extension

    APP_KEY=base64:PX6CDzfFaqmXovLwlRS2u4xm83IVnzEHiQqubS//Eg8=
    APP_DEBUG=true
    APP_LOG_LEVEL=debug
    APP_URL=http://localhost

    DB_CONNECTION=mysql
    DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
    DB_PORT=3306
    DB_DATABASE=issues
    DB_USERNAME=root
    DB_PASSWORD=root

    BROADCAST_DRIVER=log
    CACHE_DRIVER=file
    SESSION_DRIVER=file
    SESSION_LIFETIME=120
    QUEUE_DRIVER=sync

    REDIS_HOST=127.0.0.1

* Check the file .env and configure your settings about your database.

These env variables will help you in configuring your redmine server:

       URL_REDMINE
       USERNAME_REDMINE
       PASSWORD_REDMINE

And then:

    cd issues_app
