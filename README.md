# Issues application
Issues App with laravel framework.

### Server Requirements
The Laravel framework has a few system requirements. Of course, all of these requirements are satisfied by the Laravel Homestead virtual machine, so it's highly recommended that you use Homestead as your local Laravel development environment.

However, if you are not using Homestead, you will need to make sure your server meets the following requirements:

* PHP >= 7.0.0
* OpenSSL PHP Extension
* PDO PHP Extension
* Mbstring PHP Extension
* Tokenizer PHP Extension
* XML PHP Extension

### To get running:
Clone this repo by doing:

    $ git clone https://github.com/onit4ku/issues_app.git
    
And then:     
    
    $ cd issues_app
    $ php artisan serve
